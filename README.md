# Contract

This is a short piece of code that attempts to illustrate the need, assert, and revert statements used in remix.


## Description

The provided Solidity code defines a contract named "errors" that demonstrates different error handling mechanisms. It includes three functions: "Require", "Revert", and "Assert".

The "Require" function takes three unsigned integer parameters (x, y, and z). It calculates the difference between x and y and assigns the result to z. Then, it uses the require statement to check if z is greater than 0. If the condition evaluates to false, the function execution is reverted with an error message stating that the input of the first number should be greater.

The "Revert" function takes two unsigned integer parameters (x and y). It calculates the sum of x and y and assigns the result to a variable z1. Then, it uses an if statement to check if z1 is less than 1. If the condition evaluates to true, the function execution is reverted with an error message indicating that the input must be higher such that the sum is greater than 1.

The "Assert" function takes a single unsigned integer parameter (b) and returns an unsigned integer. It uses the assert statement to check if a variable named "num" is greater than 0. If the condition evaluates to false, it triggers an assertion failure. Then, it performs a division operation by assigning the value of a divided by num to b. Finally, it returns the value of b.

## Requirements

To use this contract, you will need a Solidity development environment, such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. You will also need a test network or a local blockchain to deploy and test the contract.
## Usage

To use this contract, follow these steps:

1)Open the Solidity development environment of your choice and create a new file.

2)Copy and paste the contents of Contract.sol into your file.

3)Compile the contract to check for any errors or warnings.

4)Deploy the contract to a test network or a local blockchain.
